Achievements
============

Purpose
-------

Achievements.el is meant to be a fun way to learn about Emacs.  There
is so much to learn about Emacs, that it can be quite daunting.  Using
an achievements system can hopefully make it fun.  Achievements.el
definitely doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is in a very rough state and any help is appreciated.  Especially,
since no single person can know everything about Emacs,
achievements.el will need contributions by many people to be really
useful.  So if you have ideas, send a pull request, open an issue, or
just spread the word.

History
-------

I was introduced to the idea by
[this reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ook6a/does_something_like_this_exist_for_emacs/)
about
[a similar feature for Visual Studio](http://channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio).
A few days ago I started thinking about achievements.el again.  I
couldn't stop thinking about it, and sometimes the only way for me to
move on is to start working on it.  So there you have it.
