;; Keywords: games

;;; Install:

;; A simple (require 'achievements).  However, currently it is also
;; highly recommended to install the command-frequency package in
;; order to get all the functionality.

;;; Commentary:

;; Running `achievements-list-achievements' will show a list of all
;; unlocked achievements.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: easy way to show a random unearned achievement, perhaps on an idle timer
